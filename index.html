We are the Distributed Intelligent System Lab at the Distributed System Section, EWI faculty, TU Delft. 
We are a newly established lab and work on a wide variety of research problems in distributed machine learning systems.<br> 
We greatly appreciate the funding supports from TU Delft, Aegon, Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), and Dutch National Science Foundation (NWO) to our group.
