## Robust and Adversarial Machine Learning 

**Research questions**: Can today's deep neural networks handel noisy data sets, namely corrupted inputs and lables? How to design novel learning algorithioms to dstill the data quality and enhance the robustness of learning models when encountering noisy and adversarial input? 


## Optimization for Machine Learning Clustering 
**Research questions**: Training deep models consumers tremendous computing time and resource; however tuning the hyperparameter deep models is multiple fold higher. How to achieve efficient and accurate tuning and training of DNN is highly wanted. 

## Deep Models Inference on Edge Devices
**Research questions**: How to choose a suitable train models from the plethoral of trained one and deploy at the edge devices? How to optimize the performance of deep models on the edge edvices? Can toay's edge devices efficiently execute multiple DNN at the same time, e,.g., extracting information of people, aged and gender from images?


## Federated Learning Systems: Incentive and Backdoor
**Research questions**: How to provide the incentives for users at the federated systems? How to value the contributed models from other users? Can we trust the models provided by other users?

## Tuker Tensor Decomposition (STD)
**Research questions**: Sparse Tucker decomposition is widely used in low-rank representation learning for sparse big data analysis. Due to the entanglement problem  of  core  tensor  and  factor  matrices,  the  computational process  for  STD  faces  the challenge of   intermediate  variables  explosion. How to design efficient optimization algorithm for STD without degrading approximation accuracy?

## Fair Learning for Information Spreading
**Research questions**: Users on social media with high visibility are often selected as seeds to spread information and affect their adoption in target groups. The central theme of this project is to answer how gender differences and similarities can impact the information spreading process.
