Our research themes spam in the following areas. We are interested in developing novel algorithms and efficient computational solutions for challenging research questions.



## Robust and Adversarial Machine Learning 

**Research questions**: Can today's deep neural networks handel noisy data sets, namely corrupted inputs and lables? How to design novel learning algorithioms to dstill the data quality and enhance the robustness of learning models when encountering noisy and adversarial input? 


## Optimization for Machine Learning Clustering 
**Research questions**: Training deep models consums tremendous computing time and resource; however tuning the hyperparameter of deep models is even multiple fold higher. Can one design efficient and accurate tuning framework for deep neural network such that the otpimal parameters can be found?

## Deep Models Inference on Edge Devices
**Research questions**: How to choose a suitable trained models from the plethoral of ones and deploy at the edge devices? How to optimize the performance of deep models on the edge devices? Can toay's edge devices efficiently execute multiple DNN at the same time, e,.g., extracting information of people, aged and gender from images?


## Federated Learning Systems: Incentive and Backdoor
**Research questions**: How to provide the incentives for users at the federated learning systems? How to value the contributed models from other users? Can we trust the models provided by other users?

## Tuker Tensor Decomposition (STD)
**Research questions**: Sparse Tucker decomposition is widely used in low-rank representation learning for sparse big data analysis. Due to the entanglement problem  of  core  tensor  and  factor  matrices,  the  computational process  for  STD  faces  the challenge of   intermediate  variables  explosion. How to design efficient optimization algorithm for STD without degrading approximation accuracy?

## Fair Learning for Information Spreading
**Research questions**: Users on social media with high visibility are often selected as seeds to spread information and affect their adoption in target groups. The central theme of this project is to answer how gender differences and similarities can impact the information spreading process.
