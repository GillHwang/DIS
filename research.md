## Robust and Adversarial Machine Learning 

**Research questions**: Can today's deep neural networks handel noisy data sets, namely corrupted inputs and lables? We are designing novel learning algorithioms to dstill the data quality and enhance the robustness of learning models when encountering noisy and adversarial inputs. Specfically, we are filtering out the noisy data, asking additional supervision from the experts and diversified data types, and designing noise resillient loss function.
