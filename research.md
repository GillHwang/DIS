Our research spams in the following areas. **Page under construction**


## Robust and Adversarial Machine Learning 

**Research questions**: Can today's deep neural networks handel noisy data sets, namely corrupted inputs and lables? We are designing novel learning algorithioms to dstill the data quality and enhance the robustness of learning models when encountering noisy and adversarial inputs. Specfically, we are filtering out the noisy data, asking additional supervision from the experts and diversified data types, and designing noise resillient loss function.


## Optimization for Machine Learning Clustering 
**Research questions**: Training deep models consumers tremendous computing time and resource; however tuning the hyperparameter deep models is multiple fold higher. How to achieve efficient and accurate tuning and training of DNN is highly wanted.

## Deep Models Inference on Edge Devices
**Research questions**: How to choose a suitable train models from the plethoral of trained one and deploy at the edge devices? How to optimize the performance of deep models on the edge edvices


## Federated Learning Systems: Incentive and Backdoor
**Research questions**How to provide the incentives for users at the federated systems? How to value the contributed models from other users? Can we trust the models provided by other users?

## Tuker Tensor Decomposition
**Research questions**

## Fair Learning for Information Spreading
**Research questions**
